# Mythras
Fork of mrpoid2018 with english localization and various quality of life improvements. The previous version of this was available on the mrpoid2018 repository releases page. Yichou stated on the repository and the APK code that this is free to edit as we see fit. Since the source code for the release build doesn't seem to be anywhere I had to decompile the APK and do the changes. mrpoid2018 is an emulator on android that emulates most MRP/Mythroad games. MRP/Mythroad was a platform available for flip phones in China. It's similar to J2ME, Brew and related platforms. I had originally translated and prepped the original repository for distribution but Yichou's source code is not the same version as the one in the releases tab. 

Based on my tests this should be compatible with most MRP/Mythroad games and all the ones I tested worked fine. I was unable to get this application working properly on Bluestacks and Android x86. It did however work on my two physical android phones no problem. 

A large collection of Mythroad games are available here: https://archive.org/details/mrp-games

A windows MRP/Mythroad emulator is available here: https://github.com/zengming00/vmrp/ 

The original mrpoid2018 repository is available here: https://github.com/Yichou/mrpoid2018

# Installation
Put the APK on to your android device and install it either manually or with a package manager. To build it you need to download this repository and then compile and sign the app using whatever tools you want (I used APKTools and a XDA tutorial). 

# Changelog, Version 1.1
 - New icon and splash screen courtesy of Alexis QD Pro Plus 20+. 
 - Some strings were untranslated. That has since been fixed. 

# Changelog, Version 1.0
 - Mrpoid2018 renamed to Mythras. 
 - Most text translated to english. 
 - Umeng Analytics and trackers have been removed/disabled. Note that this may break functionality of some things in the app. 
 - This has been a learning experience for me and I have not done something like this before. SOme of the code quality may be a mess and some of the anti-tracking things I added may have been a hackjob. I'm always open to suggestions. 


# To Do 
 - New and splash screen. 
 - Finding the remaining strings of untranslated text. 
 - Seeing if Yichou will release the actual source code for this. 
 - Find the lost mrpoid2018 quickstart guide. 
 - Gamepad support? Who knows? 

# Other 
If you want something changed or want to add something feel free to either fork this or create pull requests. I'll see if I can get it in.
